## Bookworm Tutorial

This is a repository I created to follow Rem Zolotykh [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi5apIbuiYg&list=PLuNEz8XtB51KthRFiVtI8cmXNL9qlQJ5U). In this video series, Rem shows how to build a full web app. The video doesn't explain much of the technology being used. So, I pause the video, learn the technology, before continuing the video.

#### Notes
I will attempt to make any notes on anything worth mentioning on here.
